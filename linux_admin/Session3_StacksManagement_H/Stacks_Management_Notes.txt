Linux Kernel is Divided into Multiple Stacks (Sub system).
    • Network.
    • Process Kernel.
    • File System.
Operating System  = User Space + Kernel.

Each Subsystem – Stack is associated with HW or Device Driver.

Command Flow In Linux:
    • Run command in terminal.
    • Call the libc library which interact with Kernel using System Calls.
    • Libc Interacts with Subsystem.
    • The Subsystem Interacts with device drivers and hardware.


1. File System Stack:
Files and directories in user-space are much different from the format of it in the memory which is binary.
    • So the First task of File system stack is changing the view from user space / storage.
    • There are two connection points between the file system stack and each user-space and storage.
    • Second task for file system stack is that it adds new storage to runtime.
    • There are multiple commands to interact with file systems and also with memory directly.
    • `lsblk` It a command that gets all storage connected to Linux machine.
    • File System understands some protocols (Ext3, Ext4, FAT).
    • Preparing A new Storage:
        ◦ Create a partition `sudo fdisk /dev/sdx`.
        ◦ Add protocol for the partition we have created `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdx`
            ▪ Makes a protocol of ext4 for partition.
        ◦ Mounting the File system type.
            ▪ `mount -t filesystem_type path/to/device_file  path/to/target_directory`.
        ◦ To umount the files
    • At least we have one mounted file system which is Root file system.

Commands:
    • To get the size of a directory `du -h –max-depth=1 <path>`s.
